  # Basic Definitions for Codes

  An error-correcting code `C` over a field `F` is a subset of `F^n` for some `n ∈ ℕ+`. It is a linear code if `C` is a linear subspace of `F^n`.

  We define the block length, rate, and distance of `C`. We prove simple properties of linear codes such as the singleton bound.
