\chapter{Introduction}

The goal of this project is to formalize Succinct Non-Interactive Arguments of Knowledge (SNARKs) in Lean. Our focus is on SNARKs based on Interactive Oracle Proofs (IOPs). We plan to build a general framework for IOP-based SNARKs that can state specifications of the protocols and prove their security properties in a clean and modular way.
