    Succinct non-interactive arguments (SNARKs) are super-important. In order for them to be used in various applications, it is crucial for such SNARKs to have fast proving time and ease of deployment. These trends are exemplified by a move toward multilinear-based SNARKs and proving general machine executions (zkVMs), with Jolt as an example of one of most perfomant zkVM nowadays.

    In this paper, we formalize key components of the Jolt zkVM, proving that the underlying interactive protocols are complete and sound. Our formalization are done in Lean, and comes with full implementations of both the prover and verifier. As independent contributions, we also provide formalizations of multilinear polynomials and binary tower fields.
