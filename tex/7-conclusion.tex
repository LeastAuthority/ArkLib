\section{Conclusion and Future Work}

Future work:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Formalize efficient implementations of curve-based scalar fields (such as BN254).
    \item Formalize polynomial commitment schemes. Expect reuse from IOP formalism.
    \item Formalize random oracles and multi-round Fiat-Shamir transform.
    \item Integrate everything into a single proof system for Jolt, proving that it indeed is a proof system for RISC-V semantics.
    \item Formalize folding schemes (Nova, Hypernova, etc.).
    \item Formally verify the current Rust code by using Aeneas~\cite{} to translate them to Lean, then prove functional equivalence with our Lean code.
    \item Automation for automatically proving soundness of interactive proofs, assuming they are built up from simpler components?
\end{itemize}
