\section{Conclusion and Future Work}

Future work:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Formalize efficient implementations of curve-based scalar fields (such as BN254).
    \item Formalize polynomial commitment schemes. Expect reuse from IOP formalism.
    \item Formalize random oracles and multi-round Fiat-Shamir transform.
    \item Integrate everything into a single proof system for Jolt, proving that it indeed is a proof system for RISC-V semantics.
    \item Formalize folding schemes (Nova, Hypernova, etc.).
\end{itemize}
